# NO SQL Challenge
Challenge 12 - NoSQL Databases

## Description
Prompt: I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to 
help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the json file using code in NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb (NOTE: for import to work correctly, must be in same directory as file is found in on terminal).
3. Install dependencies (ie. MongoClient from pymongo, pandas, and pprint)
4. Run set-up file then analysis file.

## Acknowledgments
- Used Xpert Learning Assistant for assistance debugging.
